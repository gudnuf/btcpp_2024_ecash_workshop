# Building a Custodial Lightning Wallet the Right Way

## Motivation

Traditional Lightning wallets present developers and users with a challenging dilemma:

1. Non-custodial wallets: Offer security and privacy but are complex to develop and use.
2. Custodial wallets: Provide simplicity but often compromise on privacy and user control.

Cashu emerges as a solution to this problem, allowing developers to create user-friendly Lightning-enabled applications without sacrificing privacy or dealing with excessive complexity.

## Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites for this workshop. Anyone with some motivation and persistence should be able to follow along.

However, there are some nice to haves that I will cover briefly:

### The NUTs

### Cashu mint/melt flow

### React/Next.JS

#### useState

#### useEffect

#### useCallback

#### useMemo

#### useContext

### jsdoc

### terminology

#### proof vs token

## Agenda and Goals

- Initialize a Next.JS project
- Review the boilerplate code
- Mint ecash
- Melt ecash

By the end of this workshop, you will:

1. Have built an ecash wallet that is fully interoperable with the lightning network
2. Understand how ecash is minted and melted
3.

Throughout the tutorial, we'll use [cashu-ts](https://github.com/CashuBTC/cashu-ts) to simplify our implementation and focus on the key concepts and features that make a great custodial Lightning wallet.

Let's get started on this exciting journey to revolutionize Lightning wallet development!
