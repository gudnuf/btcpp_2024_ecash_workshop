# Boilerplate

I have already started the project for you by laying out the pages and starting the hooks that we will need.

Here is the project structure:

```
src/
├── hooks
│   ├── useCashuWallet.jsx
│   ├── useProofStorage.jsx
│   └── useWalletManager.jsx
├── pages
│   ├── _app.js
│   ├── _document.js
│   ├── index.js
│   ├── offline.js
│   └── wallet
│       ├── receive.jsx
│       ├── send.jsx
│       └── transfer.jsx
└── styles
    └── globals.css
```

> > NOTE: All the files under `src/pages` are complete, we just need to implement some functions in the hooks.

## Hooks

### useCashuWallet

## Styles

This project is set up with tailwind so you can easily add styles directly to your components, but some general styles are put in `src/styles/global.css`
