# Project Setup

Everything should be setup in the Replit, but if you are not using Replit, you can follow along with the instructions below.

Make sure you have Node.js installed.

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gudnuf/btcpp_2024_ecash_workshop.git
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Bonus

If you really want to learn how to build apps like this using NextJS, start with a fresh project.

To do this, you just need to have Node.js installed, then you can run:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest
```

This will create a new NextJS app and then you can start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
