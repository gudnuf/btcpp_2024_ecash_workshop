# Building a Custodial Lightning Wallet the Right Way

## Bitcoin++ Berlin, 2024 -- ecash edition

Traditional Lightning wallets offer a stark choice: complex and non-custodial or privacy-compromising and custodial. Cashu bridges this gap, enabling developers to build user-friendly Lightning-enabled apps without the usual complexities.

In this hands-on workshop, with the help of [cashu-ts](https://github.com/CashuBTC/cashu-ts) and [Replit](https://replit.com), participants will implement sending and receiving Lightning payments while exploring privacy features, offline capabilities, multi-currency support, and user-selectable custodians.
